# Power_Eplorers_Cumilla_Ocean_trash_celan_UP
This is an autonomous Boat Run by a Single Board Computer( Raspberry Pi).
Raspberry pi Will Get Weather and Sea level change Information From Ocean Color, 
NASA Open Surface topology and NASA sea-level Change Topology. Any kind of garbage
related changes Detection from NASA Weather satellite Our Boat Will get location
from https://search.earthdata.nasa.gov/search It will update real-time. Such as 
today localized information  and it will create path where it will go  by using 
APIs our  boat will be notified. It has GPS, This will give localize information
and it conducts boat where to go.While it notified Our Boat will go to garbage 
location and collect garbage by using image processing technology  (Eg: Open Cv,
Tensor flow).while the boat will full of ocean garbage it comes to a waste 
collecting zone and it will release wastage.All the task will do automatically. 
Users can give Satellite coordinate to clean pre-define location.this boat is 
conducted by solar power so it will be a sustainable solution for collect ocean 
garbage.
